Usage
1. Go to Settings -> ea_calendar
2. Paste XML url of your calendar (this can be found by going to calendar.google.com, clicking dropdown arrow next to calendar name, clicking setting and on next page there is a ‘Calendar address’ row. Click on XML icon and choose ‘copy url’)
3. [Optional] Set number of posts to be displayed (apparently broken right now, doesn’t work). If it’s not set it’ll default to 5.
4. Go to ‘All Pages’
5. Choose page on which you want to add displayed events (ideally ‘Upcoming Events!’)
6. Edit that page
7. Put [ea_calendar] at the bottom of the page
8. Save it, you’re good to go
